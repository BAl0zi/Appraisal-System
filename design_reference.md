# UI Design Reference (from User Screenshot)

**Theme:** "Intelly" Dashboard Concept (Medical/Clinic style context, adaptable to Appraisal).

## Core Visual Traits
- **Layout:**
  - **Sidebar:** Dark, rounded container on the left (Charcoal/Black), floating slightly or full height but distinct. Vertical navigation with simple line icons.
  - **Main Content Area:** Light warm beige/cream background (`#FDFBF7` approx).
  - **Right Panel:** Some layouts feature a dedicated right column for Calendar/Timeline.

## Component Styling
- **Cards/Widgets:**
  - Highly rounded corners (approx `rounded-3xl` in Tailwind).
  - **Pastel Palette:** Soft, non-aggressive colors for different data sections.
    - Yellow/Gold for stats (Patients).
    - Pink/Rose for graphs/trends (Visits summary).
    - Green/Moss for status conditions.
    - Blue/Periwinkle for sessions/interactions.
  - **Shadows:** Very soft, diffused shadows, creating a floating effect rather than a hard material elevation.

## Typography & Elements
- **Fonts:** Clean sans-serif (Inter/sf-pro-display style). High readability.
- **Headers:** Bold, clear dark text on the light background.
- **Interactive Elements:**
  - Buttons often black pill-shaped (`rounded-full`) with white text.
  - Search bar: Pill-shaped, light background with icon.

## Specific UI Ideas for Appraisal System
- Use the **Pastel Cards** for the Dashboard summary (Targets Set, Observations Pending, Reports Completed).
- Use the **Timeline** view (right side of screenshot) for the Appraisal Phase tracking (Targets -> Observation -> Evaluation).
- **Dark Sidebar** contrasts well with the main "Paper" like background, suitable for reading long forms.

## Planned Color Palette Extraction (Approximate)
- **Background:** `#FDFBF7` (Cream/Off-white)
- **Sidebar:** `#1A1A1A` or `#2D2B55` (Existing Deep Purple could be adapted here to maintain brand while adopting layout).
- **Accents:**
  - `#F5D47A` (Pastel Yellow)
  - `#F4A4C8` (Pastel Pink)
  - `#A4C8F4` (Pastel Blue)
  - `#98B486` (Sage Green)
